<h3 class='purple center'>Studying Children’s Home Language Environments</h3>

<div class='div20'></div>

<p>In this study, we send families a soft T-shirt with a chest pocket into which parents place a lightweight audio recorder. They turn the recorder on in the morning and then go about their day as usual. Parents then send us the recorders back, and we study the different types of language interactions that children experience in everyday environments as they listen to one, two, or multiple languages.</p>

<p>In this study, your child will interact with the researcher face-to-face, using toys, books, blocks, or puppets. In some studies, we use a touch screen computer and ask children to point to pictures. Parents and caregivers are always welcome to stay with their child for the duration of the study!</p>

<h3 class='purple center'>Language Questionnaires</h3>

<div class='div20'></div>

<p>In this study, we send parents questionnaires and ask them about their child’s language environment, or about their child’s language understanding or speaking (which sounds, gestures, or words does the child understand or use?).</p>

<p>Eye-tracking is one type of study at the LDP Lab! We watch eye movements while children look at pictures and videos. This can show us what children are thinking about while they listen to language. Eye-tracking is a simple way for us to passively understand young language systems.</p>
