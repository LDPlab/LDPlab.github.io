<p>The goal of this project is to learn more about fathers' attitudes and beliefs around infant language development and the development of literacy. We also look at the role of fathers' language input in infant language development. We are recruiting families with infants between 1 and 18 months of age. The primary language spoken in the child's home must be Spanish or English (or both), and the father must live with the infant to participate. If you'd like to learn more, please send an email to <span class='purple'>lingscl@uw.edu</span>.</p>

<h3 class='purple center'>An eye-tracking study on how adults and children learn language</h3>

<div class='div20'></div>

<p>The goal of this study is to learn about what makes words easier or harder to learn for both children and adults. The study is presented as a set of short interactive video stories. We are recruiting adults aged 18+ and children aged 3-5 years. In order to participate, both adults and children must be native English speakers, with no extensive exposure to other languages. While the study is currently on hold, we will resume as soon as possible. If you are interested in learning more, please send an email to <span class='purple'>ldplab@uw.edu</span>.</p>
