<h3 class='purple center'>Eye-tracking Methodologies</h3>

<div class='div20'></div>

<p>We investigate the time course of language comprehension in children and adults using 2 eye-trackers from <a href='http://www.sr-research.com/'>SR Research</a>.</p>

<p>These eye-trackers are high speed cameras that allow us to monitor our participant's eye-movement patterns as they watch pictures or read texts on a computer screen.</p>

<h5 class='center uw-dark-gray'>Eye-tracking while listening (Eyelink 1000 Remote, LCD Arm Mount)</h5>

<div class='div20'></div>

<p>Participants sit in a comfortable chair and watch an array of images or animations on a computer monitor while listening to recorded speech (<span class='purple'><span class='d-none d-sm-inline-block'>left</span><span class='d-inline-block d-sm-none'>top</span> image</span>).</p>

<p>The eye-tracking camera is attached to the monitor, and tracks the participant's gaze every 2 milliseconds. The experimenter can monitor the fixation location in real time (<span class='purple'>the blue dots show fixations in the <span class='d-none d-sm-inline-block'>right</span><span class='d-inline-block d-sm-none'>bottom</span> image</span>).</p>

<h5 class='center uw-dark-gray'>Eye-tracking while reading (Eyelink 1000, Tower Mount)</h5>

<div class='div20'></div>

<p>Participants rest their head on a tower that also mounts the eye-tracker, as seen in the two pictures above. Sentences are then presented on a computer monitor positioned in front of them.</p>

<p>Participants' gazes are recorded every millisecond. <span class='purple'>This information can be used to infer how words and sentences are <i>understood</i> in real time</span>.
</p>

<p>The bottom video shows someone's eye movements as they read and comprehend the sentence.</p>

<h3 class='purple center'>Behavioral Methodologies</h3>

<div class='div20'></div>

<h5 class='center uw-dark-gray'>Truth value judgment tasks</h5>

<div class='div20'></div>

<p>As a child, it is hard to express their level of understanding verbally to someone, so Truth-Value Judgment tasks probe these questions indirectly. Children are told intricate stories, and a puppet who watches the story tries to describe what happened in the story. The child's task is to assess whether the puppet's statement is true or false with respect to the story. This way, children only feel that they are helping the puppet, but their assessment of the puppet's statement allows us to probe whether children understood the puppet in the same way as adults.</p>

<h5 class='center uw-dark-gray'>Elicited sentence production tasks</h5>

<div class='div20'></div>

<p>Children often make mistakes in producing words or sentences of their native language, and we try to investigate the nature of these errors by using an interactive game. For example, some of our studies present cartoon stories to children, but children need to ask questions or express their opinions to cartoon characters in order for the stories to advance (see left image below). In other studies, a child and an experimenter play a question-asking game in trying to complete a picture with missing information (see right image below).</p>

<h5 class='center uw-dark-gray'>Miniature language learning tasks</h5>

<div class='div20'></div>

<p>Language development is a process that happens over a few years, and this often makes it difficult to observe the mechanisms of change. One way to overcome this logistic problem is to actually observe the learning process in the lab. To this end, we often invent novel words, or even a novel artificial language with new words and grammars, and present these words/languages to children and how they learn over the course of the experiment (see an example image below, teaching a novel word 'togu'). These learning experiments effectively simulate how children generally learn languages, and comparison of learning process with adult participants allows us to shed light on potential differences in learning mechanisms between adults and children.</p>
