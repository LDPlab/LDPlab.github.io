    <!-- <p>Located in Smith Hall 002, the Language Development and Processing Lab is directed by Dr. Naja Ferjan Ramírez from the Department of Linguistics at UW. We investigate how infants and young children learn one, two, or multiple languages through interacting with the world! Our particular interest is in how diverse language environments impact language learning and processing in infancy and early childhood.</p> -->

    <h4>Learn about our research!</h4>
    <p>Our studies use a variety of child-friendly, safe, non-invasive methods, such as fun language games. In addition to studies that take place in the lab, we also conduct studies in children’s natural language environments: in their homes or in early education centers (e.g., schools, preschools, and infant education centers).
