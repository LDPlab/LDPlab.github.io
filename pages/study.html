<p>The Language Development and Processing Lab looks to answer why and how children learn languages so quickly, accurately, and effortlessly, while adults struggle learning new languages.</p>

<p>This question has fascinated scientists and parents for centuries. It is obvious that children are slow to develop in various aspects of cognitive development &mdash; they struggle to tie shoelaces, ride a bike, or solve complex arithmetic problems that adults can easily handle. And yet, when it comes to language learning, children seem to be far superior to adults: Every child can acquire a native command of the languages that they are exposed to, whereas many adults struggle and often fail in learning a second language.</p>

<p>Our approach to this question is two-fold. First, we investigate how language develops over the first ten years of life in order to understand the relation between experience, cognitive maturation, and language development. Second, we compare development across languages with different linguistic properties. This allows us to examine how the language learning mechanism can adapt to differences in the input. The experiments used in our labs consist of fun games and movies for children, but they are designed to investigate your child’s linguistic development. We hope you’ll enjoy reading about our findings, and that you’ll be able to visit us again in the near future. Our team members are all looking forward to seeing you!</p>
