  <h5>You and your child have the opportunity to play a very important role in our studies of how children learn language! We think you'll really enjoy participating &mdash; here is what to expect during your visit!</h5>

  <div class='div20'></div>

  <!-- Step 1: Meet us on campus! -->
  <div class='row sect-box'>
    <div class='col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-12'>
      <h3 class='pad-bottom-20'>Step 1: Meet us on campus!</h3>
      <h5 class='pad-bottom-20'>We will meet you at our lab parking spot in the <strong>Central Plaza Parking Garage: C1</strong></h5>
      <ul>
        <li>One of our researchers will meet you in the parking lot and give you an LDP parking permit</li>
        <li>They will then escort you to our lab in Smith Hall for some fun</li>
        <li>Parking is free and stress-free! For more information about parking/directions, look here! <!-- TODO link --></li>
      </ul>

    <div class='col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-12'>
      <h3 class='pad-bottom-20'>Step 2: Make yourself at home!</h3>
      <h5 class='pad-bottom-20'>We spend some time playing together before the study begins</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The main researcher and your family will play some fun warm-up games to get to know each other</li>
        <li>While playing, parents fill out some forms and have opportunities to ask any questions about the study</li>
        <li>Once ready, your child will go be a little scientist and help us with our research! Look here to learn about our studies! <!-- TODO link --></li>
      </ul>

  <!-- Step 3: Time for science! -->
  <div class='row sect-box'>
    <div class='col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-12'>
      <h3 class='pad-bottom-20'>Step 3: Time for science!</h3>
      <h5 class='pad-bottom-20'>Your child may be asked to watch some funny cartoons like this cat one!</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Eye-tracking is one type of study at LDP! We watch eye movements while children look at silly pictures and videos</li>
        <li>This can show us what children are thinking about while they listen to language</li>
        <li>Eye-tracking is a simple way for us to passively understand young language systems. Look here for more information about our findings!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class='pad-bottom-20'>Step 4: More games, more fun!</h3>
      <h5 class='pad-bottom-20'>Your child may play games with our puppet friends!</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The main researcher and your child may play an interactive game with our puppets like Mr. Snail!</li>
        <li>While playing, we can ask questions about what they understood from the videos and learn what they are thinking about!</li>
        <li>This helps us understand how they process the world around them, look here for more about our methods!</li>

      <h3 class='pad-bottom-20'>Step 5: Hard work pays off!</h3>
      <h5 class='pad-bottom-20'>After all that hard work, it's time for a toy</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Your child will receive a toy of their choosing after helping us in the lab!</li>
        <li>While they think about all the toys, we take the time to explain the purpose of the study to the parents</li>
        <li>Parents get a copy of our lab forms before we walk them back to their car! Again, directions and contact information can be found here!<!-- TODO link --></li>
