    blurb: "Naja (pronounced Naya) Ferjan Ram&#237;rez is an Assistant Professor in Linguistics at the University of Washington and holds the Distinguished Professorship in Language Acquisition and Multilingualism Endowment. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience from Brown University and her Ph.D. in Linguistics and Cognitive Science from the University of California, San Diego. She completed her post-doctoral training at the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences at the University of Washington. Naja's research focuses on understanding the extent and origins of variability in brain growth and linguistic development among young children of diverse backgrounds. She uses multiple methodologies, including naturalistic recordings in children's homes and early education centers, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and behavioral language measures in the laboratory. Naja is a proud mother of three young children who listen to and speak three languages at home: Slovene, Spanish, and English."

  - name: Lili Correa
    role: Undergraduate Student
    blurb: Lili is a senior at the University of Washington majoring in Psychology. Her main areas of interest include development and the scientific method. This quarter, she is working with Naja to explore how parents speak with their children and the direct impact this has on child language acquisition. She is especially intrigued by the malleability of childrenâ€™s brains when later learning a second language. In her free time, Lili enjoys taking her cat on walks and traveling&mdash;even if it's only to an unexplored part of Seattle.

  - name: Wenjun Ma
    role: Undergraduate Student
    blurb: "Wenjun Ma is a junior at UW-Seattle, currently working towards a double degree in Psychology and Linguistics. His research interests include the neurobiology of memory and language, neuroplasticity mechanisms of behavior, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, and language processing and development. This quarter, Wenjun is working with Naja to learn about coding and data manipulation for ongoing research projects. He is intrigued by the cognitive and brain sciences as he learned about the unimaginable human capacity to learn new skills, retain memory, acquire multiple languages, etc. Outside of the lab and classroom, he enjoys reading, traveling the world, listening to music, and spending time with friends and family."
